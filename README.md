# Rails template with variants

Simple template to bootstrap the stuff I always use (and some variants I might need) in a new Rails project.

## Prerequisites

This template currently works with:

Rails 5.2.0
MySQL

## Usage

```
$ gem install rails -v 5.2.0
$ rails new <project_name>\
  -TB\
  -d mysql\
  --webpack\
  -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manuelvanrijn/rails-template/master/template.rb
```

### libv8 errors?

```
bundle config build.libv8 --with-system-v8
```

### Install template as default for rails new

_Optional step_

Create a `~/.railsrc` file with these contents:

```
-TB
-d mysql
--webpack
-m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manuelvanrijn/rails-template/master/template.rb
```
